<h6>DAWN ROMANCE</h6>
<br><br><br>
<p class="para">Near black everywhere<br>
Light will come at the right time<br>
Called Romance of Dawn</p>
<br>
<br>
<h5>Explanation</h5>


    <p class="para">At night people are in their own houses staying still, resting, <br>
    and minding their own business but when a ray of light comes <br>
    after hours of darkness with a little moonlight, <br>
    People rhythmically always do the same thing and that is waking up <br>
    others go to work and others doing their own things. <br>
    It is called "Romance" but not connected romantically however connected in some other ways. <br>
    Dawn gives us chance to start over again, light with a little bit of shadow that's what actual romance is. <br>
    The beginning of a new day and thus a chance for happiness and improvement "Will of Dawn" that's what it's called.</p>

<h6>Dangers of Love</h6>
<br><br><br>
<p class="para">
Love is dangerous<br>
It acts as an antidote<br>
But kills like poison
</p> <br><br>
<h5>Explanation</h5>
<p class="para">
 What I meant about the antidote is that in the concept of fake love <br>
 He/she will show you good things and will make you believe that his/her love is true but in the end, <br>
 it is all an act and it will kill you like a poison when he/she will reveal the truth that it's just fake love.

<h6>War Games</h6>
<br><br><br>
<p class="para">
Sovereign's island<br>
We might lose this tug-of-war<br>
Done by a traitor.
</p> <br><br>
<h5>Explanation</h5>
<p>
    Through the years our heroes fought countless battles, people who risked their lives to eliminate ourselves from <br>
    the hands of the foreign, these people who sought freedom and independence must be given such value that our future generations will never forget. <br>
    From the names of Andres Bonifacio, Jose Rizal, Antonio Luna, and every other heroes mentioned from Philippine history books, our country remains to be <br>
    questionable in terms of absolute freedom from colonizers in terms of land ownership, and government puppetry. These heroes also epitomizes the strength, courage, and determination of Filipino fisher folk who finds catching fishes as their way of living, but find themselves as aliens in their own mother land as they were demanded to sail away by gigantic Chinese warships and vessels.

<h6>Galaxy Is a girl</h6>
<br><br><br>
<p class="para">
    You are a neverending miracle<br>
    In the void where it's nothingness<br>
    I doubt it at first, but you are more than just a typical<br>
    Like rocks wondering in darkness, there is more to it than its mineral<br>
    <br><br>
    I am not a seer, just a normal person<br>
    But every time I gaze at you I see stars untouched, a virgin<br>
    Great power is also a great danger<br>
    I hope we can be more than just strangers, great beyond lover<br>
    <br><br>
    Just as the galaxy is eternal, so does my admiration<br>
    I humbly low myself celestial being <br>
    You are a fantastic art, albeit an imperfect creation<br>
    You got it naturally never needed extra<br>
    <br><br>
    My obsession with you shall be passed to others who thirst for knowledge like I do<br>
    As time passes by, I might die before I get to know you clearly<br>
    My fiery willpower will live a century and will last through<br>
    This is a poem from a mad scientist who's in love with the galaxy, my love for you which is bigger than the bang and more than just a theory<br>
    <br><br>
    -Dr.GridtheGreed (1899) 
"I hope that people in the future will unravel the beauty behind you"
